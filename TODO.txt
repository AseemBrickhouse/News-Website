redo file structure
maybe something like
    src -
        components
            - header
                - nav
            - body
                - articleHome
                    - articleHome.js
                    - css
                - account
                - etc.
            - footer
            or just do

            - nav
            - articleHome
            - etc.
        hooks
            - debounce
            
        request -
            - articleApi
            - commentApi
            - followApi
            - accountApi

Try to write script to 
    activate venv
    run django backend
    run react frontend
    Edit: I tried and it doesnt seems like it works
